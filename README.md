What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of [supported car makes, models, and model years](docs/CARS.md). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera-based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration](docs/INTEGRATION.md) and [limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).

How to Install
------

Easiest way to install FrogPilot is via this URL at the installation screen:

```
frogpilot.download

DO NOT install the "FrogPilot-Development" branch. I'm constantly breaking things on there so unless you don't want to use openpilot, NEVER install it!

Bug reports / Feature Requests
------

If you encounter any issues or bugs while using FrogPilot, or if you have any suggestions for new features or improvements, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always looking for ways to improve the fork and provide a better experience for everyone!

To report a bug or request a new feature, feel free to make a post in the respective channel on the FrogPilot Discord. Provide as much detail as possible about the issue you're experiencing or the feature you'd like to see added. Photos, videos, log files, or other relevant information are very helpful!

I will do my best to respond to bug reports and feature requests in a timely manner, but please understand that I may not be able to address every request immediately. Your feedback and suggestions are valuable, and I appreciate your help in making FrogPilot the best it can be!

As for feature requests, these are my guidelines:

- Can I test it on my 2019 Lexus ES or are you up for testing it?
- How maintainable is it? Or will it frequently break with future openpilot updates?
- Is it not currently being developed by comma themselves? (i.e. Navigation)
